<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Link to the project][product-screenshot]](https://sen-codex.dev)

The Digital Economy Unit of the French Competition Agency (“FCA”) has developed a tool that identifies citations of the FCA’s publications in other Autorité’s publications and represents the interconnections in a graph. The creation of such a tool breaks new ground in computational antitrust research. The present open source code is designed to be publicly accessible—anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit. Open source software is developed in a decentralized and collaborative way, relying on peer review and community production.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This repository hosts the open source code written in Python. They can serve as a starting point for your own Dash app, as a learning tool to better understand how Dash works, as a reusable templates, and much more.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have python (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: \venv\scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

then you can run the app:
```bash
python app.py
```
